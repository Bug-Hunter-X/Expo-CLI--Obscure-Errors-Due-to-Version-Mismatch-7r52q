This error typically occurs when you are trying to use a feature or module that is not yet supported by the version of Expo CLI you are using.  For example, you might be using a newer React Native version than what your Expo CLI supports, or you're trying to use a feature that has not been released yet.  Sometimes this can manifest in obscure error messages which don't directly reference the Expo CLI version mismatch.
