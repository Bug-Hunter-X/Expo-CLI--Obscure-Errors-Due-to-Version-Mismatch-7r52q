# Expo CLI Obscure Errors Due to Version Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common, yet difficult to diagnose, error in Expo CLI: obscure errors resulting from using features or modules incompatible with your current Expo CLI version.  The error messages themselves often don't directly point to a version mismatch, making debugging challenging.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. **Install an older Expo CLI:** Use npm or yarn to install a version of Expo CLI known to be incompatible with your React Native or module versions. 
2. **Attempt to run a project:**  Run a project that utilizes features or modules that are only compatible with newer versions.
3. **Observe the error:** The error messages will be ambiguous and likely won't immediately identify the version mismatch as the cause. 

## Solution

The primary solution is to ensure compatibility between Expo CLI, React Native, and all dependent modules.  This can often involve upgrading or downgrading some of these components to align their versions and ensure full compatibility.

1. **Check for Updates:**  Ensure you are using the latest stable version of Expo CLI.
2. **Check Compatibility:** Verify that your React Native version is compatible with your Expo CLI version and your used modules versions.
3. **Downgrade or Upgrade:**  If there's a mismatch, downgrade or upgrade accordingly, following the guidelines provided in the Expo documentation.
4. **Review Package.json:** Carefully examine the dependencies in your `package.json` to identify potential compatibility issues.

This example highlights the importance of version management and careful attention to dependency compatibility when working with Expo CLI.
